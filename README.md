# qmf
QMF filter implementation using LFSR
This is experimental code generated by Bing AI.
It has many problems but it is interesting anyway, especially with the verilog version. 
Feel free to experiment with it. 
I would be glad to make it run on sth like Arduino

 i would be happy to see fixes :)
